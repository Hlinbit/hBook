# Solution 

## Run pod as arbitrary user


[UID and GID in openshift](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/a-guide-to-openshift-and-uids)

```bash
oc create sa sa-with-anyuid
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z sa-with-anyuid
```

## Use PVC to store the log files.

- multi-pods vs one-pvc
  We need specific file system to handle multiple sources.(NFS、GlusterFS、CephFS)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: nfs-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  nfs:
    path: /path/to/nfs
    server: nfs-server.example.com
```

- one-pod vs one-pvc
