- Pod: A Pod is the smallest deployment unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers. These containers share storage and network resources and can communicate with each other.

- Node: A Node is a machine in a Kubernetes cluster, which can be a physical machine or a virtual machine. Each Node runs Kubelet, a proxy that communicates with the Kubernetes API server and manages Pods and Nodes.

- Service: A Service is an abstract layer that defines a logical set of Pods and their access policies. Services allow stable network communication between Pods or between Pods and external clients.
- Volume: A Volume is a data storage layer that can be used by containers in a Pod. It supports multiple storage backends, such as local storage, network storage, or cloud storage.
- Deployment: A Deployment is a higher-level concept that describes the desired state of an application. It can define the number of Pod replicas, update strategies, etc.
